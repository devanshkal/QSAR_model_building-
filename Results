ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance Results
The QSAR models were evaluated using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a combined RF+SVM ensemble approach. Performance metrics for both training and testing datasets are summarized below:

âœ… Training Accuracy:
Random Forest: 83.93%

Support Vector Machine: 85.71%

RF + SVM Ensemble: 84.52%

ðŸ§ª Testing Accuracy:
Random Forest: 77.38%

Support Vector Machine: 73.21%

RF + SVM Ensemble: 77.38%

The ensemble method balanced the strengths of both individual models and achieved the highest generalization on the test data, matching the performance of RF while mitigating overfitting observed in training.
